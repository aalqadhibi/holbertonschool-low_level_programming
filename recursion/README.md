# C - Recursion

This project is part of the low-level programming series at Holberton School.  
It focuses on understanding the concept of **recursion** — a technique where a function calls itself.

## Files and Functions

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `0-puts_recursion.c` | Prints a string followed by a new line |
| `1-print_rev_recursion.c` | Prints a string in reverse |
| `2-strlen_recursion.c` | Returns the length of a string |
| `3-factorial.c` | Returns the factorial of a number |
| `4-pow_recursion.c` | Returns the value of x raised to the power of y |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c` | Returns the natural square root of a number |
| `6-is_prime_number.c` | Checks if a number is a prime number |
| `main.h` | Header file containing all function prototypes |

## Compilation
